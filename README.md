ZDL is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for Event-Driven Architectures. With Domain Driven Design principles built-in, it can be used to map the discoveries of an [EventStorming](https://www.eventstorming.com/) session.

- Designed to be developer friendly, with a simple and compact syntax.
- It retains the language of the business process discoveries found in Event-Storming sessions.
- And because it's machine-friendly it can be parsed and converted into multiple software artifacts like: 
  - documentation, drawings, API definitions like OpenAPI and AsyncAPI v2/v3 and multiple backend implementations and its tests.
